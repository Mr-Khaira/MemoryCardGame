# Getting Started with Create React App

# Memory Matching Game

This project is a simple memory matching game built with React. It demonstrates a basic understanding of React concepts such as state management using hooks like useState and useEffect. Additionally, it implements the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for shuffling the cards.

This project is demonstrated by [netNinjs](https://netninja.dev/), but I have tried to implement everything beforehand to get first-hand experience and I have additionally gone a step further by adding an automatic new game after 4 seconds and also added a conclusion window that displays the total number of steps at the end of each game with some decent styling.

## Installation

To run this project locally, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server.
Usage

Once the project is running, you can play the memory matching game by clicking on the cards to reveal them. Try to match each card with its identical pair. The game automatically starts a new round after 4 seconds and displays the total number of steps taken at the end of each round.

I will further work on more challenging projects in the future, as we all have to begin
somewhere.

Thanks ✌️.
